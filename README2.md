The ultimate goal is to create a functional social network that can provide relevant information to its users by tracking news from newsfeed and let it's user interact with the posts  by adding posts and comments to let this as a simple part of userinterface.

user registiration: the user in this page is asked to validate the account by entering his mail (must ends with gmail) and his password(must start with capital letter ) and then the user will be switched to the newsfeed page

Newsfeed: in this page the user will interact with friends post by adding a comment (this will switch him to comment scene) and the user has multiple options to choose from (add post ) or (go to his profile ) or (see notifications appearing on the right pane of this page)

add comment: in this scene the user can see other users comments and can also add his comment in the text field prompted add comment and then can return back to the newsfeed from the back button

add post: in this scene the user is given the ability to add a img or a text to post to appear in the newsfeed (note: adding image has higher priority than adding a text)

user profile: in this page the user has the abbility to see his account profile picture and friends and can logout by entering the logout button
